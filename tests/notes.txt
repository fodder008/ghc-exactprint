In hand
--------

PatternGuards : GHC D818

TemplateHaskell.hs 1 : Trac #10268

TypeBrackets : Trac #10255 D823

SlidingDoClause : Semi allowed in if stmt, need to only take it if inside the span

LiftedConstructors : Trac #10268

PuncFunctions : Trac #10269 / D832

TypeSynParens : Fix in Annotate.hs

GHC.Orig : fix rdrName2String in ghc-exactprint

AnnPackageName : fix in ghc-exactprint

NestedLambda : AnnLambda is in the GHC Anns attached to an AST span. Fix in ghc-exactprint

DefaultTypeInstance : fix in ghc-exactprint

MagicHash : HsCharPrim must always have a trailing '#' char. ghc-exactprint

GADTRecords : ghc-exactprint issue, anns are there.

MangledSemiLet : looks like annotations are ok, so ghc-exactprint issue

SlidingListComp : The AnnVbar in GRHS is capturing the annotation that belongs in the enclosed HsDo.
                - need to work around in ghc-exactprint

MultiImplicitParams : IPBinds provides its dbinds in reverse order. Fix in ghc-exactprint

UnicodeSyntaxFailure : workaround for the unicode.

See https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/master/compiler/parser/Lexer.x#L813

If Unicode is enabled, those tokens, which are normally >1 char long, are now 1
char long. We can use that to decide which string to output, pick it up in Delta
and modify our anns to include the string.

MultiLineCommentWithPragmas : Lexer.x problem with nested #-}. Discards -} from it
           D829

TupleSections : AnnComma missing, issue in Parser
           D834
           
DoubleForall : Annotation is added, but span is not in AST. Need to find the
            place where nested HsForAllTy's get collapsed, that is where we lose the span.
                #10278
          one option is D833
          
GHC tickets still to be done
----------------------------

TemplateHaskell  2 : ITopenExpQuote can be either '[|' or '[e|'. Need to capture src
                   : workaround : the annotated SrcSpan is either 2 or 3 chars long.
                   Trac ticket #10276

Needs work
----------

Undefined : BooleanFormula is not implemented.

mkHsForAllTy discards parens
  - look for all paren type processing and make sure it is safe.
    GHC.HsPArrTy
    GHC.HsParTy
    GHC.ParPat
    GHC.PArrPat
    GHC.HsPar
    GHC.ExplicitPArr
