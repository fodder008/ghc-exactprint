2015-03-24 v0.2
	This release contains a major rewrite of all internal modules.

	The external interface has also changed significantly. A description is
	omitted.

	# Top-level changes
	The most notable change is that the common structor of the modules known as
	`ExactPrint` and `Annotate` has been factored out into a common module
	(`Annotate`). The aforementioned modules are now known as `Delta` and
	`Print` and contain functions to interpret this common structure.

	The top level module `ExactPrint` now just reexports a consistent interface
	from the base modules.

	The `Utils` module is now hidden.

	Introduced a new module `Lookup` which contains a mapping from AnnKeywordId
	to their String representation.

	# Internal Changes

	`Annotate` contains all the information about which annotations appear on
	each AST element. This is achieved by building up a syntax tree (using a
	free monad) which can then be interpreted by programs requiring access to
	this information.

	# Layout compensation

	The method which compensates for layout rules has been clarified.

		1. When the Layout Flag is activated in `Annotate`. When it is activated, we mark
	the current column as the start of the layout block.

		2. This is important when we move to a new line. We take the offset at
		that current point to be the baseline and calculate the correct next
		position based on this.

		3. This method is very general as one can think of a entire source file as
		obeying layout rules where the offset is equal to zero.
